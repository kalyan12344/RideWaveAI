task2:

In Snowflake, compute and storage are decoupled, meaning you're only charged for each when you actually use them:
Storage is charged separately at a flat rate (~$23/TB/month)
Compute (warehouses) is charged per second based on warehouse size (XS, S, M, etc.)
Since warehouses can auto-suspend and auto-resume, you avoid paying for idle time. This flexibility means you can scale up for heavy jobs and scale down or suspend when idle â€” leading to major cost savings over traditional systems where compute and storage are bundled together.
